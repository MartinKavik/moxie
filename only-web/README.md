a basic attempt at demo'ing only (wip)

## running

- `npm run start` -- Serve the project locally for
  development at `http://localhost:8080`.

- `npm run build` -- Bundle the project (in production mode)

_Note: This project assumes that you have installed [`wasm-pack`](https://github.com/rustwasm/wasm-pack). Since it is needed for webpack-plugin to work._
